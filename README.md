# Photo Library Application

## Overview

This is a **Photo Library Application** built with:

* **Backend:** Python (Flask + SQLAlchemy + SQLite)
* **Frontend:** React (Axios + Material-ui + ESlint)
* **Database:** SQLite (`photos.db`)

The app allows users to:

* Upload, edit, and delete photos
* Organize photos into directories
* Add tags and descriptions
* Search photos by tags, descriptions, filenames, or directories
* Serve uploaded images through a dedicated endpoint

## Deliverables

1. **Complete Source Code** – Flask backend (`app.py`, `models.py`, etc.)
2. **Database Schema** – SQLite schema (`photos.db`, `view_db.py`)
3. **AI Prompts/Models (if applicable)** – No AI prompts or models are included.
